# NYC Vehicle Collision Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of vehicle collisions in New York City (NYC), segmented by **boroughs**, **time of day**, and **months**. The analysis utilizes Python for data manipulation and visualization, combined with Tableau for additional visual storytelling.

The primary goal is to uncover trends, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights into collision incidents, focusing on the impact of time and location on collision frequency and severity.

## Data Story Highlights

### Key Findings:
1. **Time-Based Trends**:
   - Collision rates increase significantly during late afternoons (3 PM - 6 PM), with **Brooklyn** and **Queens** showing the highest impact.
   - **Morning hours (6 AM - 12 PM)** exhibit relatively lower collision rates.

2. **Borough Insights**:
   - **Brooklyn** and **Queens** consistently record the highest number of collisions and casualties, likely due to their high population density and traffic volume.
   - The analysis suggests a focus on **targeted safety measures** during peak hours in these areas.

3. **Zip Code Analysis**:
   - Certain zip codes exhibit consistently high collision rates across seasons, indicating localized hotspots for traffic incidents.

#### 2. **Brooklyn and Queens Casualty Comparison**

- **Description**: A detailed comparison of vehicle collisions resulting in casualties across Brooklyn and Queens for the year 2015, focusing on the afternoon hours.
- **Insights**:
  - **Brooklyn** shows peak collision counts in the late afternoon (3 PM - 6 PM).
  - **Queens** sees a consistent rise in collisions, peaking in the late evening (6 PM - 9 PM).

#### 3. **Collision Intensity by Zip Code**

- **Description**: A heatmap of vehicle collisions across NYC zip codes for the months of January and April during the afternoon hours (12 PM - 6 PM).
- **Insights**:
  - Darker shades represent areas with consistently high collision rates.
  - Certain zip codes exhibit persistently high collision frequencies irrespective of seasonal changes.
